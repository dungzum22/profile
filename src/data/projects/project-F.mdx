# Introduction

This project centers on developing and testing a utility that calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. The primary goal is to ensure the correctness and robustness of the calculation logic through comprehensive unit testing.
## Key Features

- **Hypotenuse Calculation**: Computes the hypotenuse given the lengths of the other two sides.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that inputs are positive numbers.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative errors for invalid inputs.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Implements unit tests to cover various scenarios and edge cases.

## Technical Insights

- **Testing Framework**: Utilizes Mocha as the test runner for structuring and executing tests.
- **Assertion Library**: Employs Chai for expressive assertions to validate test outcomes.
- **Mocking and Spying**: Uses Sinon to create mocks and spies, facilitating the testing of functions in isolation.
- **Code Coverage**: Integrates Istanbul (nyc) to measure test coverage and identify untested code paths.
- **Continuous Integration**: Sets up workflows to automatically run tests and report coverage using Codecov.


## Challenges and Solutions

- **Ensuring Accurate Calculations**: Developed precise test cases to validate the correctness of the hypotenuse calculations.
- **Handling Invalid Inputs**: Implemented input checks and corresponding error messages to guide users.
- **Maintaining High Test Coverage**: Regularly monitored coverage reportss to identify and address gaps in testing.


## Outcome

The project successfully demonstrates the implementation of unit tests for a mathematical utility, emphasizing the importance of testing in software development. It serves as a reference for best practices in writing and maintaining tests using Mocha, Chai, and Sinon.
